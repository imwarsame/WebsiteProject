# motivation
the site was inpsired by http://webpage.pace.edu/kp31080n/omnifood/ . A web design course I took on Udemy a few months ago and I wanted to do something similiar for de montfort uni students seeing I always eat on campus and the healthy options are always expensive and take longer to prepare compared to their junk food counterpart

# features on the site - js, css, parallax, smooth scroll
The site includes fully validated HTML5,CSS3 and JavaScript. As well as parallax effect, slideshow for the testimonial page, and smooth scroll features. I've also made use of Ai and included a dmu-logo SVG, menu SVG and iphone with the DMU logo on its screen.
# P.A.R.C
Proximity: Related items should be grouped close together. This provides the viewer with a visual cue that this items are similar and should be treated as a group - In this case, similar items like the li elements within the submenu class have the same color when hovered on to indicate they belong together. Another way to show promixity is spacing, I've decreased the spacing between the li elements in the submenu class to indicate their relation to on another and increased spacing between li elements on the landing page and the DMU-logo svg to show they aren't related. These group elements based on color and distance automatically creates organization.

Alignment: I've taken care in developing the site to have good alignment as this helps make pages look clean and
cohesive. I've used span in the parallax class to allow for good alignment with h2 element within the same class. The same is also true with the h2 and li elements within the section class.

Repetition: In web design, repetition gives consistency. I've adjusted the font-weight on p, testimonial .text and .title .byline elements to 400 to achieve this affect. List-style-type for the slides and ul.submenu are sent to none as well amongst others.

Contrast: in short contrast is used to distinguish between two or more different things. The section headers on the how it works page are bolder and darker compared and thus contrast with the li elements. I've also used darker colored text on white background to add to this affect.
